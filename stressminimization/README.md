# Team 2.1

Repository für Team 2.1  - Java Projekt VANTED Erweiterung durch Layoutverfahren für große Graphen

# Documentation

The getting started guide for the stress minimization plugin can be found in Documentation/StressMinimization alongside with the generated javadoc files.

The same documentation for the multilevel framework is located in the Documentation/MultilevelFramwork directory.

# Binaries

Compiled addon jar files for both addons can be found in the vantedsource/StressMinimization and vantedsource/MultilevelFramework directories, respectively.

# License

This project is licensed at the terms of the GNU General Public License Version 3. Please refer to the LICENSE.txt file for details.

Licenses and notice files of the used libraries, as well as an library overview are located in the Licenses directory.

# Benchmarks and Tests

StressMinimization benchmarks are placed at orga/benchmarks. Several benchmarks for different development stages exist, however some of these benchmarks are flawed due to a bug in the benchmark code unknown at creation time.

A smaller selection of benchmarks for the Multilevel Framework is located alongside it's documentation in Documentation/MultilevelFramework. 

Benchmarking code is contained in vantedsource/StressMinimizationTests and vantedsource/MultilevelTests. Unit tests can also be found in these directories.
