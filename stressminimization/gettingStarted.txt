Stress minimization
getting started

This add-on calculates the total stress in the graph and changes
the layout to minimize this stress. This usually results in
nice looking layouts if the graph does not have too much edges.

You can change the following parameters:

*Auto redraw
If checked, after every iteration of the layouter, the current layout
will be shown in VANTED. This greatly increases the computation time, 
but gives a nice animation of the graph slowly moving into its new
layout.

* Landmarks count
The amount of nodes in the graph that gets layouted. By default,
this value is equal to the total number of nodes in the graph.
Lower numbers will greatly decreses the computation time.
If this value is too low, the resulting layout will not be optimal.

* Weight factor
TODO find out how this works

* Stress chnge threshold
The minimum amount of total stress change that has to happen in
each iteration. If the total stress change falls below this amount, 
the computation terminates. 
Lower numbers may result in longer computation time.
Higher numbers may disturb the resulting layout.

*Node movemend threshold
Minimum total node movement that has to happen in each iteration.
If the total node movement falls below this amount, the computation
terminates.
Lower nubers may result in longer computation time.
Higher numbers may disturb the resulting layout.

*Iteration Maximum
Maximum number of iterations until the computation terminates
The default value is 75, which is usually enough iterations that
the other termination criteria will trigger first. 

*Randomize initial layout
If checked, the layout of the graph will be randomized before 
applying the stress minimization layout. Use this if the graph
has been layouted before to minimize the chance of artifacts
from the previous layout remaining in the new layout.
